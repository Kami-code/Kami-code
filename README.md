# Intro
I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and I will join CMU in 2023 Fall. I am currently working as an intern supervised by Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/index.html) at the University of California San Diego. I am also working with Prof. [Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/), in MVIG Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include Robotics and Computer Vision, especially object manipulation, representation learning, and reinforcement learning.
