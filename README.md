# Intro

I recently graduated with a Master's degree from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Prof.[Abhinav Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/) on foundation model. During my graduate studies, I also collaborated with Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/index.html) at UC San Diego, focusing on robotic manipulation and computer vision. Prior to CMU, I conducted research at MVIG Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and Dr. [Wenqiang Xu](https://wenqiangx.github.io/).


   I am currently seeking PhD positions for Fall 2025. My research interests include generative AI for robotic perception and manipulation, reinforcement learning and imitation learning, and visual representation learning using Internet-scale data.
